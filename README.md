# Welcome! 👋

My name is Ana Lucía Rodríguez Lotero, and I'm a full-stack developer from Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia. I'm passionate about programming, especially frontend development, although I'm also interested in learning more about full-stack development. 

## ✨ About Me
- 🌱 I enjoy continuously learning new things and improving my skills as a developer.
- 🎓 I studied at the Universidad Católica de Pereira and obtained my degree in Software Development Technology, and two years later, the degree in Systems Engineering and Telecommunications.
- 💼 I have three years of experience in the fintech sector as a full-stack developer.

## 🚀 Projects
I am currently working on several projects that are not yet ready to be shared publicly on GitHub. I am excited to share them with you in the future, so make sure to revisit my GitHub profile for updates.
